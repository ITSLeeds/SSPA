## Session outline:

> - Recap on progress with the coursework
> - Practical working on your projects
> - (And an opportunity to ask questions)

## Recap on previous sessions

> - Many examples of indicators presented (none right or wrong)
> - Why bother creating indicators?
> - What different types of indicators are there?
> - How can geographic data analysis help?

Key resources:

- Slides + video by Ian on assessment
- The QGIS booklet with simple example indicator: https://itsleeds.github.io/QGIS-intro/

## Why make indicators?

Source: [@boisjoly_insider_2017]

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/el-geneidy-metrics.png")
```



## Indicators change the world

> - Most indicators emphasise time saving and economic growth, leading to the misled emphasis on motorised modes and speed [@banister_sustainable_2008]

> - Different indicators can lead to different policies.

> - The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is changing how millions of Â£ is being invested in cycling, making it more evidence-based [@lovelace_propensity_2017]

## Indicators can be simple | If communicated effectively

See www.pct.bike

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npct/pct-team/master/figures/front-page-leeds-pct-demo.png")
```

## Tip: be skeptical of existing measures

```{r, out.width="40%"}

<!-- Issues: unclear colourscheme -->

<!-- Unclear what motivation is -->

## An interactive catch-up on progress (virtual hands up)

> - Who plans to use QGIS? 
<!-- > - Who plans to use R? -->
<!-- > - Who plans to use a bit of both? -->
> - Study area decisions
> - Indicator aims decided
> - Data access
> - Data analysis started

## Progress with coursework

- Gantt charts are useful!

## Examples of good project reports

## Warning on using large datasets

- But first 5 commandments of Big Data [see @lovelace_big_2016]:

> 1) thou shalt remember the purpose of thine research regardless of the size of thine dataset
> 2) thou shalt not spend excessive amounts of time making visualising big data for the sake of it (or social media clickbait)
> 3) thou shalt not do big data until thou has done 'small data' first
> 4) thou shalt not hide thine ideas behind complex terminology associated with the terms 'big data' or 'data science', the meaning of which has not been clearly identified.
> 5) if thou wants to be a data scientist thou must program ... "for documentation, sharing and scientific repeatability" ([mount 2016](http://www.r-bloggers.com/some-programming-language-theory-in-r/)).

<!-- ## Next steps:  -->

<!-- > - Another commandment: do not get distracted by Big Data -->
<!-- > - High priority: crack-on  -->
<!-- with the coursework -->
<!-- > - check-out the big data and big data archives slides -->
<!-- > - CRACK-ON with the coursework! -->
<!-- > - I'll present on Big Data in due course... -->
