# Recap on accessibility

## Definition of accessibility

What was accessibility again?

> - Ease with which an individual can access desired services and facilities
> - Different types of accessibility, depending on purpose (education, shopping, etch)
> - By different modes of transport (e.g. cycling)
> - Technical question: at what level does accessibility operate?

Why is it a good sustainability mobility indicator?

> - It incorporates social, economic and environmental factors
> - Provides information at local level for cost-effective interventions

## Example

What are we looking at here? How could it inform policy?

## Access to what? 

Proximity to fast food can be a bad thing ([Burgoine and Monsivais](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/868/art%253A10.1186%252F1479-5868-10-85.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fijbnpa.biomedcentral.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2F1479-5868-10-85&token2=exp=1458091279~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F868%2Fart%25253A10.1186%25252F1479-5868-10-85.pdf), 2015).

- Access to fast food and supermarkets linked with obesity
- Few measures include information about service quality

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2, fig.width=2}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../figures/food-exposure.png", 3))
```

# Distance decay

## What is distance decay?

A function that links the proportion of trips to distance:

$$
p = f(d)
$$
See Iacono et al. (2008)

## Why is it important?

![](../figures/dd-anna.png)

## Functional forms of distance decay

See Martinez and Vargas (2013):

- Exponential functions, $e^{\beta x}$ 
- Power functions, $x^{\beta}$ 
- Tanner functions, $x^{\beta_1}e^{\beta_2 x}$ 
- Box-Cox functions, $exp(\beta \frac{x^{\gamma} - 1}{\gamma})$ when the parameter $\gamma \neq 0$ and $x^{\beta}$ when $\gamma = 0$ 

# Case study: Propensity to Cycle Tool

## Input data

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Input: A mass of data"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/haystack.png")
```

See Lovelace et al. (2016)

## Making the data interactive

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/coventry-centroids.png")
```

## Route allocation - affects access

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/fast-quiet-man.png")
```

## Route network analysis

![](../figures/cov-rnet.png)

## Accessibility under scenarios of change

See Lovelace et al. (2016)

- Government Target
- Gender Equality
- Go Dutch
- Ebikes

## Scenario shift in network load I

## Scenario shift in network load II

# Practical

## Feedback on R

- How did you find R?
- Anyone used R beyond practical?
- How did it compare with QGIS?
