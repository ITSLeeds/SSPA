## What is transport data science?

- The application of data science to transport datasets and problems

--

- Raising the question...

--

- What is data science?

<!-- You tell me! -->

--

- A discipline "that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge" `r Citep(my_bib, "grolemund_r_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

--

In other words...

- Statistics that is actually useful!

---

## What is science?

.pull-left[
- Scientific knowledge is hypotheses that can be falsified
- Science is the process of *generating falsifiable hypotheses* and *testing them*
- In a reproducible way
- Systematically

]

--

.pull-right[

- Falsifiability is central to the scientific process `r Citep(my_bib, "popper_logic_1959", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`
- All of which requires software conducive to reproducibility

## Transport planning software

Transport modelling software products are a vital component of modern transport planning *and* research.

- They generate the evidence base on which strategic investments are made and, furthermore,
- provide a powerful mechanism for researching alternative futures.

--

It would not be an overstatement to say that software determines the range of futures that are visible to policymakers. This makes status of transport modelling software and how it may evolve in the future important questions.

What will transport software look like? What will their capabilities be? And who will control? Answers to each of these questions will affect the future of transport systems. 

--

- Premise: transport planning/modelling software used in practice ~~will become~~ is becoming increasingly data-driven, modular and open. 

---

## A geographic perspective

- See https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md

- Paper on the **stplanr** paper for transport planning (available [online](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/stplanr-paper.html)) `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_stplanr_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`
- Introductory and advanced content on geographic data in R, especially the [transport chapter](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html) (available free [online](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)) `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` 
- Paper on analysing OSM data in Python `r Citep(my_bib, "boeing_osmnx_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` (available [online](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01890)) 

```{r geocompr-cover, echo=FALSE, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/images/cover.png")
```

---


## Data science and the tidyverse

- Inspired by Introduction to data science with R (available free [online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) `r Citep(my_bib, "grolemund_r_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`


```{r tds-cover, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b88ef926a004b0fce72b2526b0b5c4413666a4cb/24a30/cover.png")
```

---

## Current transport software

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
file.copy("../transport-software.csv", ".")
tms = readr::read_csv("transport-software.csv")[1:5]
tms = dplyr::arrange(tms, dplyr::desc(Citations))
knitr::kable(tms, booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Sample of transport modelling software in use by practitioners. Note: citation counts based on searches for company/developer name, the product name and 'transport'. Data source: Google Scholar searches, October 2018.", format = "html")
```

# Online communities

- [gis.stackexchange.com](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions) has 21,314 questions 

- [r-sig-geo](http://r-sig-geo.2731867.n2.nabble.com/) has 1000s of posts

- RStudio's Discourse community has 65,000+ posts already!

--

- No transport equivalent (e.g. earthscience.stackexchange.com is in beta)

- Potential for a Discourse forum or similar: transport is not (just) GIS

# Applications

---

## What can you use these skills for?

- Example: the Propensity to Cycle Tool ([PCT.bike](http://www.pct.bike/)) (Lovelace et al. 2017)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npct/pct-team/master/figures/early.png")
```

---

## How is data science used in the PCT?

- It's all reproducible, e.g.:
- Find short in which more people drive than cycle

--

- Stage 1: get data from web

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Aim: get top 1000 lines in repo
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines_all = pct::get_pct_lines(region = "west-yorkshire")
desire_lines = desire_lines_all %>% 
  top_n(1000, all)
write_sf(desire_lines, "desire_lines.geojson")
piggyback::pb_upload("desire_lines.geojson")
```


```{r, message=FALSE}
# Set-up, after installing pct and checking out www.pct.bike:
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines_all = pct::get_pct_lines(region = "west-yorkshire") %>% 
  top_n(n = 1000, wt = all)
```

---

## Stage II: Geographic data analysis

- Interested only in top 200 lines in Leeds

```{r}
leeds = osmdata::getbb(place_name = "leeds", format_out = "sf_polygon")
desire_lines = desire_lines_all[leeds, , op = st_within] %>% 
  top_n(n = 200, wt = all)
```


---

## Stage III: Visualising (polution) data

<!-- A fundamental part of data science is being able to understand your data. -->

<!-- That requires visualisation, R is great for that: -->

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
.pull-left[
plot(desire_lines)
]
.pull-right[
]
```


<!-- - Interactively: -->

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines("all") +
  tm_basemap(server = c(leaflet::providers$OpenStreetMap, leaflet::providers$SafeCast))
```


---

## Stage IV: Origin-destination data analysis

- Now we have data in our computer, and verified it works, we can use it

- Which places are most car dependent? 

```{r}
car_dependent_routes = desire_lines %>% 
  mutate(percent_drive = car_driver / all * 100) %>% 
  filter(rf_dist_km < 3 & rf_dist_km > 1) 
```

- Get routes

```{r, eval=FALSE}
routes = stplanr::line2route(car_dependent_routes)
car_dependent_routes$geometry = routes$geometry
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
sf::write_sf(car_dependent_routes, "car_dependent_routes.geojson")
piggyback::pb_upload("car_dependent_routes.geojson")
piggyback::pb_download_url("car_dependent_routes.geojson")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
car_dependent_routes = sf::read_sf("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.2/car_dependent_routes.geojson")
```



---

## Communicating results:

```{r}
b = c(0, 25, 50, 75)
tm_shape(car_dependent_routes) +
  tm_lines(col = "percent_drive", lwd = "all", scale = 5, breaks = b, palette = "-inferno")
```

---
