# SSPA

The goal of this repo is to get you up-to-speed with using R for handling spatial data.

It assumes you have a basic understanding of R and spatial data, that can be obtained by following an online tutorial such as that provided by DataCamp or by following [Chapter 2](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html) of the online book [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/).

The main tutorial is [accessability](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/blob/master/accessability.Rmd), which is best followed as a print-out from the `accessibility.pdf` file provided as a download in the project's [releases](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/releases).

Before starting you sould download the project repo (which contains the necessary data) from: [github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/archive/master.zip).
